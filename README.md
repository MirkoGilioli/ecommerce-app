## Overview
This project is a scalable eCommerce application built using microservices architecture. It consists of multiple services that handle various aspects of an eCommerce platform, including user management, product management, cart functionality, and order processing. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of the following microservices:
- **Frontend**: A React-based frontend application.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- **Product Service**: Handles product listings and details.
- **Cart Service**: Manages shopping cart functionality.
- **Order Service**: Handles order processing and management.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Microservices built using [your preferred language/framework]
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run
- **Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring, OpenTelemetry
- **Load Testing**: Locust

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-microservices.git
   cd ecommerce-microservices
   ```

2. Set the following variables in the terraform.tfvars:
   ```plaintext
   PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   LOCATION=your-gcp-region
   FIRESTORE_LOCATION=your-firestore-location
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

### Deploying the Application
1. Apply Terraform configuration to set up the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

2. After successful deployment, the application will be available at the Cloud Run URL provided in the Terraform output.

## Microservices
### Backend Microservices
Each backend microservice is built as a separate Docker container and deployed independently. The following microservices are included:

- **User Service**
  - Endpoint: `/api/users`
  - Port: `5003`

- **Product Service**
  - Endpoint: `/api/products`
  - Port: `5001`

- **Cart Service**
  - Endpoint: `/api/cart`
  - Port: `5004`

- **Order Service**
  - Endpoint: `/api/orders`
  - Port: `5002`

### Frontend
The frontend application communicates with the backend services via RESTful APIs.

## Testing
Load testing is implemented using Locust. To run load tests:
1. Deploy the Locust service to Cloud Run.
2. Access the Locust web interface and configure your test scenarios.

## Monitoring and Observability
The application uses OpenTelemetry for monitoring and Google Cloud Monitoring for observability. Ensure that monitoring is set up to track the performance of each microservice.
